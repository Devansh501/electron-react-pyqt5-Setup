This file lists modules PyInstaller was not able to find. This does not
necessarily mean these modules are required for running your program. Both
Python's standard library and 3rd-party Python packages often conditionally
import optional modules, some of which may be available only on certain
platforms.

Types of import:
* top-level: imported at the top-level - look at these first
* conditional: imported within an if-statement
* delayed: imported within a function
* optional: imported within a try-except-statement

IMPORTANT: Do NOT post this list to the issue-tracker. Use it as a basis for
            tracking down the missing module yourself. Thanks!
